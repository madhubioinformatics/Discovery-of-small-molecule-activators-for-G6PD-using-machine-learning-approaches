#Discovery of small molecule activators for G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) using machine learning approaches

Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic enzyme converting glucose-6-phosphate into 6-phosphogluconate in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
The G6PD deficiency renders the inability to regenerate glutathione due to lack of NADPH and produces the oxidative injury in retina that accelerate the dystrophic 
conditions to photoreceptor  cells and damage the retinal blood barrier function. In this study, we constructed pharmacophore-based models based on the compound complex 
of G6PD with AG1 (G6PD activator) followed by virtual screening. 53 hit molecules were mapped with core pharmacophore features. We calculated molecular descriptors, 
clustering, principle component analysis (PCA) to pharmacophore hit molecules and further applied statistical machine learning methods. Results showed that the all 
model performed best and classified as drug-like (18) and nondrug-like (35) compounds. The drug-like compounds were further evaluated our established cheminformatics 
pipeline (molecular docking and in silico ADMET analysis). Finally, five hits with different scaffolds were picked out for docking studies and in silico ADMET analysis.
This study proposes that the combination of machine learning methods with traditional structure-based virtual screening can effectively strengthen the 
ability in finding potential G6PD activators designing for G6PD deficiency diseases. Moreover, these compounds can be considered as safe agents for further validation 
studies at cell level, animal model, and even clinic setting.
